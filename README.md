# Mega's Path of Exile Loot Filter
This is my loot filter for Path of Exile. 

## Perandus League Changes
The only change specific to the Perandus league is the addition of "Perandus Coin" as a currency. 

## General Design Philosophy


## Leagues Specific Filters
A different branch is created for new leagues, such that the base item filter remains intact and league specific changes are kept in the league. After a league is finished, the non-league specific changes are ported into the main filter. The league specific filters are not deleted, but they are also not kept up to date.

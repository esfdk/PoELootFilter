# Mega's Path of Exile Loot Filter
This is my loot filter for Path of Exile. 

## General Design Philosophy
My filter focuses on the following three principles
* Use of the standard game colours (and variations thereof)
* Show most items
* Only play sound when a valuable item drops

## Credits
I would like to thank Sayya for making a great loot filter for Path of Exile. My loot filter is based on version 1.23. Forum thread: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1260712
Another big thanks goes to Muldini for making the "One Filter To Rule Them All". I have copied, stolen and pirated large amount of his work and I take no credit. My filter is based on version 2.33. Forum thread: https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1259059
Neversink's Filter and Filterblade.xyz has also helped a ton in making of small good changes to colouring, filter order and the map tiers.
I would also like to thank ImperatorFeles for making a Notepad++ syntax for PoE loot filters: https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/34g9rp/basic_syntax_highlighter_for_notepad_for_item
